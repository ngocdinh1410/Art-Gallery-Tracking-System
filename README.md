# Art-Gallery-Tracking-System
3 Phases of Art Gallery Tracking System
The Art Gallery accepts original artworks by living contemporary artists to be sold on a commission basis. It currently offers work from about 100 artists, and sells approximately 1000 pieces each year. The average selling price is several thousand dollars. There are about 5000 customers who have purchased pieces from the gallery. The sales staff consists of the gallery owner, Alan Hughes, and 4 sales associates. Their activities are supported by an office staff of 2 people.
The artwork wants to migrate to a digital database. Here are there current paper forms:
1. Artist Information Form.  When Alan interviews an artist, he collects contact information and data about the artist’s usual works
2. Collector Information Form. When the gallery begins to offer works owned by people other than the artist, these collectors will also be interviewed. They may own one or many artworks, and their collections may or may not have works that are predominately by a single artist or of a single type, style, or medium. 
3. Artwork Information Form. For each artwork to be considered, the interviewer fills in the basic information needed for the description card. If the piece is chosen to be offered for sale by the gallery, the date listed and the asking price are filled in.
4. Sale Invoice When a work is sold, the sales associate fills out the form. Currently, a copy is given to the buyer, and the original is placed in the files. The unique invoice number is preprinted on the form.  When the database is created, the invoice will be produced by the system. 
5. Mailing List Form
6. Active Artists Summary Report The report lists summary data about all active artists, including the total amount of each one’s sales for last year and this year.
7. Individual Artist Sales Report The report  would be generated for a period starting with whatever date is selected (e.g. January first of the current year) and ending with another selected date (e.g. today's date). It lists all the works of that artist that the gallery has received from the listing date specified to the date of the report. The status of the work can be sold, returned, or for sale. If the work was sold, the date sold and selling price are listed. If the work was returned, the return date is listed. If the work is for sale as of the date of the report, the asking price is listed. The total amount of sales of the artist’s works during the period is displayed. The total value of asking prices of the artist’s works currently for sale is also given. By choosing dates that cover the entire year, the total sales data on this report can also be used for the end-of-year tax reporting required by the government.
8. Collectors Summary Report.  The Art Gallery plans to begin selling works owned by collectors, in addition to works owned by the artist who created them.  
9. Individual Collector Sales Report. This report is similar to the one for individual artists. It will be needed when the gallery begins to sell works owned by collectors. It gives information about works the collector has offered for sale through the gallery. It lists all works sold, works returned, and works for sale for that collector for the period specified. The total sales for each collector is sent to the government for tax reporting purposes at the end of the year. 
10. Works for Sale This report lists data about each work that is currently offered for sale in the gallery. The date of the showing to promote the work, if any, is given. The total of all asking prices is given. 
11. Sales This Week This report lists data about all sales of works during the current week. It is divided by salesperson, showing each of the works that salesperson has sold this week, and his or her total sales. At the end, it gives the grand total of all sales for the week
12. Buyer Sales Report The report shows buyers in alphabetical order by last name. Works purchased this year are listed by date of purchase.
13. Preferred Customer Report Alan would like to target potential customers as well as current ones, by keeping information about all those who attend showings, or whose names are gathered from the potential customer information form. For each present and potential customer, he would like to keep identifying data and information about the customer's preferences, such as the name of a preferred artist, type, medium, and style for each customer. He hopes to increase sales and hold down costs by using this information to make up targeted invitation lists for showings of works that match customer preferences. This report could be run for the artist or artists being featured in a show. It lists potential customers whose stated preferences list the same artist, type, medium, or style as the works shown.
14. Salesperson Performance Report The report  would be generated for a period starting with whatever date is selected (e.g. January first of the current year) and ending with another selected date (e.g. today's date). It provides an individual listing of each of the works sold by that person during the period, as well as his or her total sales for the period. Typically, it would be run once a month, to evaluate each salesperson’s performance.
15. Aged Artworks Report This report  is generated at the end of each month. It lists the works of art that have been for sale in the gallery for six months or more. Alan uses it to contact the artist or collector to determine whether the works should be returned, or remain for sale for an additional period of time. 
16. Owner Payment Stub When an artwork is sold, a check is sent to the owner for 90% of the selling price. 
17. Art Show Details For each show, this report provides information about the dates, featured artist or theme, and works shown. 
After analyzing the business needs and the forms, we created the following E-R model:

![Revised Relational Model](https://github.com/ngocdinh1410/Art-Gallery-Tracking-System/blob/master/Revised%20Relational%20Model.png)
We edited the relational model to make sure the model meets the 3NF.
